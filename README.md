# Everest

A ReactJS-based to-do list application. Allows you to sign in and store tasks in their respective categories/projects (e.g. Work, School, Family, etc). Tasks get processed through Natural Language Processing for date parsing and filtering. 

# Inspiration

I remember seeing a video on Youtube of a developer attempting to build a Todoist (popular task manager) clone in ReactJS. Immediately felt inspired and dared to recreate the core features that Todoist has to offer (NLP date processing, task filter, categories, etc.) Hope you enjoy!  

# What I Learned

* Data normalization
* New way of creating redux code (thanks @acemarke)
  * I shared my code with the Reactiflux community and was introduced to a new way of creating Redux reducers, actions, store, etc. Many thanks to one of Redux's maintainers, Mark Erikson. Redux boilerplate is much smaller and cleaner.
* Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data from database
* Handling private and public routes/pages
